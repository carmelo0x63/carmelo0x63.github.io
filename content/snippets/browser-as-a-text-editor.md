In your browser's `address bar` (i.e. where you'd type `www.blahbla.com`) enter the following [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL)
```
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```
The browser becomes (sort of) a text editor. Useful for quick note-taking.
